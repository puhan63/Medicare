The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provides detailed data on prescription drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D beneficiaries. This dataset includes key information such as prescriber National Provider Identifiers (NPIs), total drug costs, brand and generic drug names, and geographic variations in prescribing behavior. Notably, the dataset also captures opioid prescribing rates at the regional level.

This project focuses on performing a comprehensive analysis of these data to identify meaningful patterns and insights related to medication utilization and prescription claims among Medicare recipients. The goal is to synthesize the information into actionable findings that enhance understanding of prescribing trends, cost dynamics, and opioid-related behaviors within the Medicare system.
